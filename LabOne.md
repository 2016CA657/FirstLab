# First Lab: Setup

## Git
Git is a distributed version control system designed to facilitate modern, multi-party development.
Perhaps the most important feature of Git is that it allows developers to keep track of changes in 
their code, to develop different features, to create projects that build on other work, and to be
able to track and undo any steps along the way. 

Because it is *distributed*, Git facilitates development by one or more people at one or more places.
Local version control is maintained separately in each place, and can be synchronised to a remote
repository as needed. While Git is a very popular approach to source control, it can be a difficult
technology to learn, both from a theoretical perspective, and due to the sometimes-counterintuitive
commands.

If you've not used Git before, please follow the tutorial below: 
<https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1>

An introductory tutorial to GitLab (the "protected" version of github) will be delivered as part of the first Lab.

## Amazon AWS

Amazon AWS is a cloud stack that provides compute, storage, database, and other functionality from a centralised console.
The Web Services provided are based on a pay-per-use model, with different criteria depending on the service. 

AWS has a free trial tier, please sign up for it:

## Send your details

Please email your gitlab username and amazon AWS username to [alessandra.mileo@dcu.ie](mailto:alessandra.mileo@dcu.ie)

## Bonus: Set up Hadoop

Download Hadoop and run the example single-cluster grep application.
<https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html>

You might need to install oracle java, or to ensure that the ports are listening correctly.
